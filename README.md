# Google Deep Dream

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of the Google Deep Dream algorithm. Deep Dream is a computer vision program that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images through algorithmic pareidolia, creating a dream-like psychedelic appearance.

## Introduction
Deep Dream was originally developed by Google to visualize the patterns learned by a neural network. This repository allows you to experiment with Deep Dream using a pre-built Jupyter Notebook, enabling you to transform images with surreal, dream-like appearances.

## Features
- Apply Deep Dream transformations to your own images.
- Adjust parameters to control the intensity and style of transformations.
- Explore different layers and activation patterns within the network.
- Visualize how neural networks "see" and interpret images.

## Installation
To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, you need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GoogleDeepDream.git
   cd GoogleDeepDream
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook GoogleDeepDrean.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `GoogleDeepDrean.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook cells.
3. Upload an image you want to transform.
4. Configure the settings (layer, intensity, etc.) as desired.
5. Run the notebook cells to generate and visualize Deep Dream images.

## Examples
Here are some example transformations generated using the notebook:
