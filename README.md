# Google Deep Dream

*Deep Dream* focuses on visualizing and amplifying features or patterns learned by a deep neural network, often by feeding an image through a trained network and iteratively adjusting the input image to maximize activations of a specific layer.
The idea is to highlight features that the network has "learned," resulting in intricate, dream-like imagery that reveals how the network "sees" patterns and structures in the data.

## Introduction
Deep Dream was originally developed by Google to visualize the patterns learned by a neural network. This repository allows you to experiment with Deep Dream using a pre-built Jupyter Notebook, enabling you to transform images with surreal, dream-like appearances.

## Features
- Apply Deep Dream transformations to your own images.
- Adjust parameters to control the intensity and style of transformations.
- Explore different layers and activation patterns within the network.
- Visualize how neural networks "see" and interpret images.

## Installation
To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, you need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GoogleDeepDream.git
   cd GoogleDeepDream
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook GoogleDeepDrean.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `GoogleDeepDrean.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook cells.
3. Upload an image you want to transform.
4. Configure the settings (layer, intensity, etc.) as desired.
5. Run the notebook cells to generate and visualize Deep Dream images.
